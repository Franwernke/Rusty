# Rusty
### Introduction
Repository to all my Rust exercises and my whole path into learning Rust.
Many exercises will be taken from the book "The Rust Programming Language" (or simply *THE BOOK*).
I'll be watching the Let's Get Rusty tutorials found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSp-OaMpsO8K0KkOqyBl7_w).
### Running
To run any exercise, cd into the directory and build the project using the command:

```cargo build```

Then run it using:

```cargo run```
